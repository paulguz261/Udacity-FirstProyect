The cod should run with version 3. or above. In adition the following libraries must be imported

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. skelarn
4. pyploy.matplotlib
5. seaborn

Otherwise there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.


## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was created to understand how different amenities and variables affect the properties price in Seatle. 

For this project, the kaggle Airbnb Seattle dataset was used, the following questions were solved.

1.Which amenities offered are important to the price ?
2.Do the amount of amenities offered affect the pricing?
3.Which other characteristics are important in pricing ?
4.Can we make a prediction using the variables available ?
